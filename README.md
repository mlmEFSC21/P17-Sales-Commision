# P17-Sales-Commision
Module 10 Project 3 (Sales Commission)

Preface
A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive a base salary of $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a net salary of $650. The company needs a tool to input the week's gross sales for each employee and displays how many of the salespeople earned a net salary within a set of ranges.

You are to create a web form that displays a table with the net salary ranges and the number of employees in each range. Your form should prompt the user for the employee's gross sales for the week, calculate the employee's net salary, determine which range the net salary belongs to, and update the table accordingly.

Requirements
Write a script (using arrays) that obtains the gross sales for each employee through an HTML5 form and determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges (assume that each salesperson’s salary is truncated to an integer amount):
$200–299
$300–399
$400–499
$500–599
$600–699
$700–799
$800–899
$900–999
$1000 and over
Include a title at the top of the page called "Company Salary Range Counters"
In the form, provide a textbox for the user to enter the gross sales amount for an employee.
Also, provide a "Submit" button to submit the value stored in the textbox, initiate the calculation of the employee's net salary, and update the table accordingly.
Ensure that the table has the headers, "Range" and "Number of Employees"
Be sure to include a "Clear" button that clears the textbox and resets the table and variables used in your script.

For Full Points
